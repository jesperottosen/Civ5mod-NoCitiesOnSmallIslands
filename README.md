# Civ5mod - No Cities on Small Islands



Includes a check before city building wrt the number of water tiles around the location.

Allows for some canal-type locations.

Polynesia, though, get to settle.



Key DLL work by whoward69 requires Various Mod Components (v 105).



**Key lessons**

* RTFM, I needed to enable the functions in the mod before they could trigger
* The function "IsFreshWater" is really *does this field have freshwater* so it's not relevant here
* Build the function up slowly using print statements
* Chek your variables, and remember if you count water or land



**Future extensions**

* investigate ring 2
